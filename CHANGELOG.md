## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-17

### Added

- **Multi-restaurant booking system** — customers browse restaurants, hold tables in real-time, and book instantly. No account required; bookings are identified by a short `BookingRef` code.
- **Admin dashboard** — manage reservations, tables, floor sections, booking pauses, and branding from a dedicated panel. Supports multiple restaurant locations per instance.
- **Real-time table holds** — 5-minute in-memory hold placed on a specific table when a customer selects a time slot. The `holdId` is required at booking time, preventing double-bookings during checkout.
- **IANA timezone-aware availability** — all `DateTime` values stored in UTC; restaurant-local open/close hours are computed via the restaurant's IANA timezone field.
- **Popular-times categorisation** — every 30-minute slot tagged `Lunch`, `Dinner`, or `Off-Peak` based on industry benchmarks; surfaced as labelled pill tabs in the frontend.
- **Booking pause** — admins can halt new reservations until a specific date/time without touching config files.
- **Full white-label branding** — app name, primary color, and favicon icon (10 Lucide icons) configurable from the admin settings panel. PWA identity (manifest name, theme color) updates live.
- **Dynamic PWA icons** — `/api/brand/pwa-icon.svg` and `/api/brand/pwa-icon-{192|512}.png` generated on-the-fly via Magick.NET (cross-platform, no native deps).
- **SMTP email notifications** via MailKit (optional — app degrades gracefully without SMTP config).
- **VAPID push notifications** (optional — app degrades gracefully without VAPID keys).
- **GDPR-compliant hard-delete** — admins can permanently purge individual booking records.
- **Encrypted recent-bookings cookie** — HttpOnly cookie via ASP.NET Data Protection; lets customers look up their recent reservations without an account.
- **OWASP ZAP API scan in CI** — every push runs a ZAP API scan against the full Docker stack using the OpenAPI spec (`/openapi/v1.json`) for endpoint discovery.
- **100% frontend test coverage target** — Jest + React Native Testing Library; Playwright E2E tests against the live Docker stack.
- **Multi-arch Docker images** (linux/amd64 + linux/arm64) published to GHCR on every tag push. Pi and NAS boxes supported out of the box.
- **Pinned release docker-compose.yml** — attached to every GitHub Release so self-hosters can `docker compose up` without cloning the repository.
- **Automatic EF Core migrations on startup** — the backend applies any pending schema migrations before accepting traffic. Upgrades from previous releases are safe and require no manual SQL.
- **SQLite backup and restore documentation** — see [`docs/backup-restore.md`](docs/backup-restore.md) for automated backup scripts and upgrade procedures.
- **Migration safety CI** — a dedicated GitHub Actions workflow validates that new EF Core migrations produce identical schemas whether applied to a fresh database or an existing one.
