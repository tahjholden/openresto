/**
 * Cross-platform scroll-to-element: on web, calls the DOM `scrollIntoView`;
 * on native, measures the target against the enclosing ScrollView and scrolls
 * to it manually. Callers own the trigger condition and delay (layout needs
 * to settle first — see call sites for the ~150ms setTimeout pattern) since
 * those differ per usage; this only wraps the actual cross-platform scroll
 * mechanics so they can't drift between call sites. See CLAUDE.md's
 * "Cross-platform scroll-to-element" note.
